Summary:

This is a first draft of a script to generate an apparmor deny
policy subset based on a set of allow rules.

Motivation:

Apparmor is a pathname-based mandatory access control system.  It
evaluates deny rules before allow rules, and deny rules cannot be
overriden by an allow rule.  However, in lxc we have cases where we want
to deny by default, and whitelist some paths.  For instance, we want to
deny write to most of /sys, but make exceptions for /sys/fs/cgroup
(which may be bind-mounted in a write-safe way) and /sys/class/net
(which is namespaced so that all its contents are owned by the
container).  Using this script, we can represent this by

block /sys
allow /sys/fs/cgroup/*
allow /sys/class/net/*

Specific Example:

Using the configuration in the file called 'config' in this repo,
the script provides the following output:

deny /home/user1/[^d]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/[^d]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/[^d]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/d[^io]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/d[^io]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/d[^io]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/di[^rp]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/di[^rp]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/dip?*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/dir1?*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/dir[^1]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/do*/** wklx,
deny /proc/sys/kernel/[^s]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /proc/sys/kernel/s[^h]*{,/**} wklx,

deny /sys/f[^s]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/[^c]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/c[^g]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cg[^r]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cgr[^o]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cgro[^u]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cgrou[^p]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cgroup?*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs?*{,/**} wklx,

which can be appended to the container-base apparmor abstraction file.
