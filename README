Summary:

This is a first draft of a script to generate an apparmor deny
policy subset based on a set of allow rules.

Motivation:

Apparmor is a pathname-based mandatory access control system whose
policy is driven by denial statements.  However, in lxc we have
cases where we want to deny by default, and whitelist some paths.
For instance, we want to deny write to most of /sys, but make
exceptions for /sys/fs/cgroup (which may be bind-mounted in a
write-safe way) and /sys/class/net (which is namespaced so that
all its contents are owned by the container).  We can represent
this by

block /sys
allow /sys/fs/cgroup/*
allow /sys/class/net/*

Example:

Using the configuration in the file called 'config' in this repo,
the script provides the following output:

deny /home/user1/[^ddd]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/[^ddd]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/[^ddd]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /home/user1/d[^iio]*{,/**} wklx,

deny /sys/fs/cgrou[^p]*{,/**} wklx,
deny /sys/fs/cgroup?*{,/**} wklx,

which can be appended to the container-base apparmor abstraction file.
